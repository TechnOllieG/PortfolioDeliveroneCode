The FixPrefabLink.cs was a simple tool I wrote to fix an issue where I had accidentally edited positions of lots of lights in play mode. I then copied the lights when I realized that I was in fact in play mode and that my changes would be discarded otherwise, but all of the prefab links to the light prefab had been broken. So this script assumes that the input objects have the same structure as a input prefab and simply restores their prefab link.
